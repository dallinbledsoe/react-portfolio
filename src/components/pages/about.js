Wolves
Before I start my story I’ll give you a little bit of a background. Levi, Sam and Jaxon, all cousins, and Chandler are my best friends. Levi, Sam, Jaxon, and I used to play football back in the day, during the time when this fight happened. Chandler is a short stocky Hispanic kid that has been one of my best friends since sixth grade. Morgan, Kennedy and Liv are just a few girls a year younger than us that we happened to be going to a movie with. My friends and I are sometimes pushing it with people trying to mess with them, but not ever looking to fight.
Levi, Sam, and I drive over to AMC Theatre to go buy our tickets for the movie after a long day of buying school clothes at the mall. My mom gave me $150 dollars to spend for my school clothes for the first day of school. It was Christmas. Wearing my new forest green converse and Pac Sun shirt, we meet up with, Jaxon, Chandler, Kennedy, Liv, and Morgan at the theatre planning on watching Mission Impossible III. We park in the far parking lot, two to three blocks away, next to Down East furniture. 
After I bought my ticket, Levi, trying to be obnoxious, decided it would be a better idea to watch Ant Man. I begrudgingly return my ticket and we all get our tickets for Ant Man for 6: 30. The movie didn’t start for another hour so we started walking back to our car which was across the street in the far parking lot. Levi continued being obnoxious and we kept laughing. As we began walking, two tall kids our same age come out from behind the theatre. 
One of them, a tall Hispanic kid wearing a TAPOUT hoodie with cut-off sleeves and baggy jeans was rapping loudly while his buddy was snapping to give him a beat. His friend was black with a flat top haircut wearing a navy blue NIKE shirt and matching bright orange basketball shorts. They started walking towards us while we were sauntering over to our cars across the street. 
“Hey, you guys rap?” the tall kid yelled across the parking lot. Just after Levi answered him with his big mouth looking to kill some time before the movie.
 “Yeah man!” Levi said as they walked over to us.
“Let’s have a rap battle,” the black kid said. A third kid walked out from behind the building. He was at least 6 ft. 4 in. tall, and big. He was wearing a white sweat suit, with red bandana print, shirt and pants. He was wearing big red Adidas shoes and had diamond earrings. 
“Lookin’ fly man!” I say just trying to be nice with my hand outstretched for a high-five. He stopped walking and looked at my hand with a you’re-white-don’t-touch-me look. Sam and Chandler burst out laughing at the rejection. My face turned bright red and I chuckled as he walked past and stood next to his two friends. 
After he rapped a freestyle (obviously memorized) while his friends were dancing and snapping, Levi asked the tall Hispanic kid what his ‘rapper name’ was. 
“Chucky,” he responded. 
“Oh like Chucky Cheeses?” Levi said as we all burst into laughter.
“No!” Chucky said, in disgust as everyone walked off, being urged by the girls to go back to the cars.
I hung back for a second. “Alright check me out, I’m about to spit some fire,” I say jokingly as I begin to walk away. They all laughed as the big black kid insisted that I can’t rap. “I just don’t want to hurt any feelings,” I say in disrespect as I turn my back to them.
I walk away and at our cars we plan out the next hour before the movie. The three kids walk over to us again before we could get in our cars. The big black kid walked right up to Chandler and got in his face.
“What are those?” he says pointing at Chandler’s white vans while his posse laughed their heads off and went “Ooooooooooo,” as if it was a big diss. “What did you get your outfit at Wal-Mart? You look like a faggot man!” He said as he shoved Chandler back a few feet. That’s when it got real.
I got right into the big black kids face in defense of my friend. “What are those?” pointing at his shoes. “What are those?” pointing out his outfit. “What are you wearing bandana pajamas?” 
I glance toward Chandler for a split second before my chin got hit by the big black kid’s fist. Somehow I rolled with it and it didn’t do much damage. The big black kid stepped back and squared up with his fists up.
“Finna ta mess you up kid,” He said expecting me to cower. My heart began racing. My eyes were locked on the kid standing five feet in front of me. I couldn’t comprehend what was going on. It had escalated so fast. I was never expecting a fight. As my mind finally came together, my options were black and white. You can turn around and walk away and let him get the best of you, or you teach this kid a lesson. Knowing my options, I never wanted to fight but I knew I couldn’t walk away.
“Alright,” I say as I raise my fists up to my chin. “Let’s go.” Everything went quiet. I didn’t even notice the girls running off scared for their lives. 
I start circling and he circles right with me. I get a little closer to him with every step. A familiar voice in my head, not my own, tells me I need to take him into the ground. Take him to the ground. I have to take him to the ground.
He steps toward me and swings with his right hand looking to knock me out. His hand misses my face by just an inch as I step back, and quickly step towards him wrapping my hands around his back. My head under his right armpit, he wraps his arms around mine, trying to keep me from punching his side. With my hands clasped together I swivel my feet and drive him, using all my adrenaline, to the ground. I straddle his prone body on the hot summer asphalt. My knees tear and bleed from scraping. 
His arms, still clenched above my elbows, keep me from punching him. I yank, and get most my arm out except for my hands. He holds tight knowing that if he lets my hands go he will be in trouble.
“It’s one on one!” I hear Levi repeatedly yell in the background. Cars in the background whiz by in the parking lot. I make one last effort to pull my hands free and his hands immediately go a few inches in front of his face to protect himself.
Clenching my fists as hard as I can I draw my hand back and land my right fist right into his cheek followed by a left; pounding his head into the asphalt. That left followed by another right, each punch rapidly thrown after each other like a machine gun. The next right hand sent his chin to the asphalt and the left clocked his face back to the other side. Two more rapid punches follow. I pull my bloody knuckled hand back as his body lay lifeless on the asphalt, ready to punch again.
Something hits the back of my head. My eyes start to go blurry, I begin lose my balance, and I lean to over feel my face hit the asphalt. With blurred vision I see a tall figure standing over me. He raises his foot over my face and I close my eyes as I hear a yell from Chandler. I reopen my eyes and see Chandler tackle the tall kid before he could kick me in the face. The black kid with the flat top punches Chandler in the face, and then confronts Sam. Levi and Jaxon wisely stay out of the fight.
I get back on my feet. “We’re done!” I yell again and again before Sam can seriously hurt the kid as we run to our cars. Sam, Chandler and Jaxon all run into Sam’s car as the two kids punch his windows and yell cuss words, trying to break them as they drive off. Before I get in my car I notice the big black kid laying on the ground. He lay lifeless with his hands covering his bloodied face. 
	Levi and I get in my car and drive away pick up the girls before getting the heck out of there before the police can get involved. The next hour was filled with the girls chewing me out, and all my friends praising me for standing up for Chandler, and Chandler calling me a, “savage.”
	Violence is wrong. You shouldn’t fight to get gain, to get revenge, or just fight to fight, but when you are defending yourself, or even a friend I believe it is okay. I believe sometimes walking away is the wrong thing to do. If I walked away I would be showing Chandler I’m not willing to defend him and the black kid and his friends would’ve gotten the best of us. Say what you want, but in the end one thing matters. I did it for Chandler. My friends are my family. My Brothers. Without them I am weak.
